Hackathon Project: Stereotype Detection Tool

This project focuses on building a data generation tool powered by a customized OpenAI assistant to create a dataset of sentences that are either neutral or contain stereotypes. Using the ALBERT (A Lite BERT) model, I trained a classifier to detect whether an input sentence contains stereotypes. This tool aims to enhance awareness and understanding of stereotype detection through AI-driven solutions.
